# weather-bot
Simple telegram weather bot with **NodeJS**. Bot can give current weather for a given location and manage subscriptions for users to be alerted everyday with weather prediction.

## Requirements ##
- Create a bot and get your bot token. More info in [Telegram web.](https://core.telegram.org/bots) 
- Register for free and get your token in [OpenWeatherMap.](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Tested on node 7.10.0.

## Installation ##
Edit the following info in `config.js`.  

- Place your telegram bot token in `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.  
- Put your openweather token in `OPENWEATHER_TOKEN`.  
- Set the absolut path for sqlite database file in `SQLITE_DB_PATH`.
- Install sqlite3 (if it is not present) on your OS.

Download dependencies and run in NodeJS:  

    npm install   
    node index.js    

## sqlite3 installation ##

### Windows ###
- Go to [SQLite download page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and download precompiled binaries for Windows (I choosed a bundle of command-line tools for managing SQLite database files, including the command-line shell program, the sqldiff.exe program, and the sqlite3_analyzer.exe program.).
- Create a folder `C:\>sqlite` or whatever you want and unzip the files inside it ( or just place the file in a folder already in your `PATH`).
- Add `C:\>sqlite` in your `PATH` environment variable.
- Go to terminal and type `sqlite3`, you should see SQLite version number.

### Linux ###
First option, the easiest, but probably official repositories will not have the last version:
- Open terminal and type `sudo apt-get install sqlite3`

Second option:
- Go to [SQLite download page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and download sqlite-autoconf-*.tar.gz from source code section.
- Run the following code.
    ```
    tar xvfz sqlite-autoconf-3190300.tar.gz
    cd sqlite-autoconf-3190300
    ./configure --prefix = /usr/local
    make
    make install
    ```

### Mac OS X ###
- Same procedure than for Linux if sqlite3 is not installed already.

## Considerations ##
This bot was made just for fun, I just did it to learn basics of Telegram bot API. I have it running on my Raspberry Pi. If you use this bot and it gets so popular that many people use it, please consider limitations of the API.

From [Telegram web](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#my-bot-is-hitting-limits-how-do-i-avoid-this).
> **My bot is hitting limits, how do I avoid this?**
> 
> When sending messages inside a particular chat, avoid sending more than one message per second. We may allow short bursts that go over this limit, but eventually you'll begin receiving 429 errors.
> 
> If you're sending bulk notifications to multiple users, the API will not allow more than 30 messages per second or so. Consider spreading out notifications over large intervals of 8â€”12 hours for best results.
> 
> Also note that your bot will not be able to send more than 20 messages per minute to the same group.

> **How can I message all of my bot's subscribers at once?**
> 
> Unfortunately, at this moment we don't have methods for sending bulk messages, e.g. notifications. We may add something along these lines in the future.
> 
> In order to avoid hitting our limits when sending out mass notifications, consider spreading them over longer intervals, e.g. 8-12 hours. The API will not allow more than ~30 messages to different users per second, if you go over that, you'll start getting 429 errors.

From [OpenWeatherMap web](https://openweathermap.org/price), free plan allows **60 calls per minute**.
